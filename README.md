# Brand-Popularity-Prediction
Recurrent Neural Networks to track the popularity of Facebook fan pages.

 Data is gathered from different car brand pages, which consists of all the posts, time and day of the posts, post type (video, photo, status), the number of reactions, comments and shares on each post, and the change in the number of fans based on these features. Goal of this project is to predict the fan growth of a page up-to next week.
